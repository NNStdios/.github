# No Name Studios
We are a small team of Unity game developers, each with over three years of experience.<br/>
Our primary focus is on 3D PC games, although we have extensive experience in both 2D and mobile game development.<br/>

Some of the projects we've worked on are:
- [<b>ChronoScape</b>](https://nnra6864.github.io/nnra/?page=Projects&project=24)<br/>
A visually appealing Flappy Bird remake featuring unique timescale mechanics and the ability to blow up lightning.
- [<b>Save The Nord</b>](https://nnra6864.github.io/nnra/?page=Projects&project=21)<br/>
Project features complex game-UI interactions and has an interesting backstory that shows the importance of making equal progress in preserving the nature and science.
This game got into finals of the RAF Challenge 2022.
- [<b>Hopeless</b>](https://nnra6864.github.io/nnra/?page=Projects&project=22)<br/>
While not overly complex, paired with a smooth presentation entirely created in Unity, won the first place at MET Talents 2023.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to reach out, we'll be glad to work with you!
